Module 4 Challenge Project

This web app is a timed quiz. The original project was a JavaScript-themed quiz, but the author instead opted for a 007-themed quiz. This quiz is a series of questions, and the user's score is based on the correct answers in the alloted time.

The construction of this app has been used to expand and improve the author's understanding of JavaScript, CSS, & HTML.
